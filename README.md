# C867-Class-Project

This is a class project completed for Western Governors University.

Written in C++, this program parses through a given set of strings containing student information and prints them.
Although the use of Vectors instead of Arrays may have been a more effective choice to complete this program,
the use of Arrays was a requirement of the course for the purpose of showing competancy in C++ and having to
use more creative methods of completing the task.

"int main()" is found in roster.cpp
